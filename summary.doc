    For the game Risk that I began, I used pyGame as my main framework in which to build 
this game. Pygame allowed me to import their built in tools where I can generate UI effectively 
to create a more visually appealing game. The most exciting aspect I found about pygame is the 
ability to draw maps given latitudes and longitudes. I created a draw_map function in python and used
pygames tools to render it onto the screen upon startup.

    The most challening obstacles I faced were two things. Firstly what was challenging was 
building this game off of someone else's initial code. The initial code wasn't documented
properly so I had to throw it into ChatGPT in order to get an understanding of what was going 
on so I can build off of it. Secondly, the game of Risk is a fairly simple game but to develop
it as a web game is far more challenging and I found that I overscoped it. 

    If I were to start this project over I would plan it out better because I realized 
that this project is a long term project that would be challenging, for even the most experienced
programmr, to complete in a few days. Overall I think that, eventhough the game is as functional as
I would have liked it to be, the learning experience of not biting off more than I can chew I think is 
more rewarding than the code I actually built.
